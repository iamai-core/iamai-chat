## Project Overview

AMAI is an open-source project dedicated to developing cutting-edge AI technology that runs entirely on personal devices, without relying on cloud services. Unlike traditional AI models that require cloud infrastructure for training and processing, IAMAI provides users with complete control over their data and AI models. This ensures enhanced privacy and accountability, addressing growing concerns about data security and the ethical implications of cloud-based AI systems.

## Company Overview

IAMAI specializes in building AI companions that learn and grow continuously based on user interactions, offering a truly personalized experience. The technology combines high-performance core systems written in C/C++, optional Python for AI agents, and a modern frontend built using JavaScript and React. This project allows for seamless integration of text, audio, and visual interfaces to interact with AI assistants.

## Key Highlights:
- Open-Source AI: IAMAI focuses on providing a transparent, open-source framework for AI development.
- Local, Private Data Processing: All data is processed locally on personal devices, ensuring that user data remains private and secure.
- Real-Time Data Processing and Neural Networks: The project emphasizes real-time data processing and AI model training using consumer-grade hardware.
- Cross-Platform Architecture: Students will gain hands-on experience developing cross-platform AI systems capable of running on various devices.

## How to Contribute:
Contributors will work alongside AI assistants like Claude to accelerate development and learning. They will be involved in tasks such as system programming, neural network training, and enhancing user interfaces, all while keeping privacy and performance in mind. Students will have the opportunity to make meaningful contributions that will reshape the AI landscape.
